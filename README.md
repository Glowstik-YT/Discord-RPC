# Discord-RPC
A simple Discord RPC Template for my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/glowstik (please subscribe :D)

## How to Use

- Go to the discord developer dashboard and create a new application
- Copy the application ID to clipboard and head to rich presence tab
- Add an asset by selecting an image (towards the bottom of the page) and set it to a name such as "icon"
- Go to the main.py file and copy it into your code editor
- Open it up and add your bots ID as well as update the image
- Run the file and enjoy :D

(you will need discord for desktop for this to work)
